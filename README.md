# Optic-Calculator

**This project is not currently being worked on**

## Description

This is a optical application that will allow the user to trouble shoot optical issues, and assist with day-to-day optical calculations.


## Intended Functions

Eyewear.py file contains Eyewear class that is meant to construct Eyewear objects that can contain attributes and functions of the user's eyewear. It should then be able
to determine what type of measurements and adjustments may need to be made to the user's eyewear.

There are also static methods in the Eyewear class that allow the user to request a description of certain terms applicable to optics, such as single or multi focal types of vision,
and to be able to determine what the best course adjustment is needed to be made to someone's prescription or physical eyewear based on determined issues (visual or tactile).


## In-Progress

Static functions for user to use as tools for determining necessary adjustments and term descriptions
